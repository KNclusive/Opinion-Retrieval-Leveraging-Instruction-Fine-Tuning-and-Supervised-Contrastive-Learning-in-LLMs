This repository is maintained by Karan Nair strictly for the purpose of documenting my thesis during my masters at National University of Galway, Ireland (NUIG).

To run the experiments, Create a shell python environment on ubuntu (or any linux distribution of your choice) and then run requirements.txt
The python version used for this experiments are 3.10.14

The Experiments depend on Hugging_Face to load and save models as well as WandB to log metrics and other run details. Please replace your hugging_face and wandb token at places nessasry.

Cheers!
